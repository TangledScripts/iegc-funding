            <p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
            <p>We are writing to formally request short-term mobilization funding in the amount of $8,000 initially, with a potential follow-up request of $15,000–20,000 to support the execution of multiple active and upcoming commercial construction projects.</p>
            <p>Our company, Inland Empire General Contractors INC, is a licensed general contractor based in Lake Elsinore, Ca operating since 2019. We have built a strong reputation for quality and reliability, currently maintaining a growing pipeline of awarded projects totaling over $265,488.22.</p>
            <p>Our current need stems from a well-defined cash flow gap between the start of projects and the time of payment disbursement — a common challenge in fast-moving construction environments.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="sections">
            <section class="section">
                <h3>Phase One Funding:</h3>
                <p>We are currently on a project that requires approximately $8,000 to cover final mobilization expenses, wage catch-ups, and remaining materials. This project is near completion, and we are scheduled to receive payment of approximately $25,841.53 on June 5th. Accounting for banking timelines, funds would clear around June 7th or 8th, at which time we propose full repayment of this initial funding phase.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h3>Phase Two Funding:</h3>
                <p>Immediately following, we are scheduled to mobilize for a new project located in American Canyon, California. This job requires upfront support of $15,000–$20,000 to cover relocation costs, crew lodging (Airbnb), fuel, per diem, initial materials, and wages. This project is expected to generate another $31,792.76 in revenue approximately three weeks after mobilization, with full repayment planned directly upon receipt of those funds.</p>
                <p>This second disbursement's timing and necessity may also be influenced by our evolving project pipeline. Should the next project location remain within proximity to American Canyon (e.g., San Francisco or Santa Barbara), mobilization costs would be lower or possibly negligible. However, if the next mobilization requires deployment to Reno, Long Beach, or San Diego, a similar round of funding support may be required.</p>
            </section>
        </div>

        <section class="section">
            <h3>Our Commitment:</h3>
            <p>This approach gives lenders a clear and transparent repayment path tied directly to confirmed payouts and allows our company to scale responsibly while protecting relationships with our loyal workforce and established clientele. We are not a company in distress. We are a rapidly scaling construction firm with strong client relationships, a proven history of performance, and a reliable team in place. Our request is for short-term, project-backed funding to bridge gaps that traditional financing does not accommodate quickly enough.</p>
            <p>Enclosed are bank statements, contract summaries, scopes of work, and financial documents, along with legal business credentials. We welcome further dialogue and are ready to provide any additional information upon request.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to partnering with you to meet this short-term funding need and continue delivering high-value results.</p>
